# Image Encryption Tool

This Python program implements a simple image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation. The tool allows users to encrypt images by altering pixel values using a specified key and then decrypt those images using the same key.

## Features
- Encrypts images by applying a mathematical operation to each pixel value.
- Decrypts images by reversing the operation using the same key.
- Supports images in PNG format.
